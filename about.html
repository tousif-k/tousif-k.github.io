  <h1>Hey,</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Tousif, <strong>data scientist</strong> and student at the City College of New York studying <strong>applied mathematics</strong>. 
    I'm currently working at IBM as a <strong>software developer intern</strong> under the IBM Global Financing department.

    While I enjoy coding and have been hobby coding since middle school (when I programmed my first text-based RPG game), what I live for are its
    applications to serve the people and solve pressing issues in society. For this reason, I have been learning data science and 
    machine learning applied to the fields of public health and urban sustainability. You will find my portfolio to generally have projects
    related to the two, as well as labor studies and political economy. In the long term I intend on attending graduate
    school for a degree in biostatistics, though for now I am self-studying bioinformatics through

    Outside of this, I read a lot of books. Books about philosophy, history, politics, and occasionally meet up with friends to study and discuss texts together.
    For a while now, I have been involved in my communities, to engage with people and work towards the full realization of their democratic rights. In my downtime,
    I enjoy playing some Nintendo Switch and watching anime.
